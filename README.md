Javascript-The-Good-Parts
=========================

Just some exercices from the book "Javascript The Good Parts". To execute the test, just:

* Prerequisites: node.js installed.
* Resolve the dependecies: npm install. It will read the package.json and will install all the dependencies (mocha, expect, sinon, should...).
* Execute the test: mocha (from the root folder).
